 The Jungle Cook
 (https://n315-data-bryce.web.app/#)
 The jungle book is a complete Firebase CRUD app that allows you to create, view, edit, and delete recipies. When first opening the app you will be on the home page from there the broswe page will work but unless you login you will not beable to see the created recipes or do any editing. Once logged in or signed up you can go to create page. Here it allows you to create a recipe with a img url, name, description, cook time, serving size, ingredients, and instructions. Once Created you can see all created recipes on the your recipes page. The your recipe page is where most functionality is. You can view recipes, edit, and delete from this page. Clicking view will take you to the view page and show all details a button on the bottom will let you edit the current recipe.. The edit page will show all current details but here you can edit all. The delete button just does the deletes the chosen recipe from firebase. If a user is logged in the navigation will change to allow for the your recipe page and create page but it will also allow you to log out. The app is also fully responsive to 1024px for tablets.
